# Your assistant on the phone

Your assistant can be reached by telephone, day and night, like a dedicated personal secretary. It answers the call, greets you, and holds a real voice conversation: you speak, it understands, and it replies with its own voice. You can ask for information, request a task, or dictate work to be done, exactly as you would in the chat.

> **Platform note:** phone access needs the speech-recognition component of AgentBridge, which today ships for Windows only. On macOS the SIP engine itself is cross-platform and ready, but the speech-to-text piece is planned for a future release — see the [technical notes](TECHNICAL-NOTES.md) for the roadmap. Telegram, documents, email, research, scheduling and podcasts work fully on your Mac today.

## How it works

AgentBridge connects to a phone system through the SIP standard and becomes a phone endpoint. When someone calls, the assistant answers automatically and, if you have set a PIN, asks for it before starting the conversation. The PIN protects the assistant from strangers: after three wrong attempts, the line refuses further tries for a full day.

## Making the assistant reachable

For the phone to ring, AgentBridge needs to be connected to a phone service or a small server that links the call to your line. Once that link is in place, the assistant is available around the clock, whether you call from the office or from your mobile phone. You can also place outgoing calls through the assistant if you configure it to do so.

## Privacy in every call

The conversation is understood and spoken entirely on your machine. No audio is stored on cloud services, and the same privacy rules that apply to the chat apply to the phone.

The next guide shows another way to talk to your assistant from anywhere: Telegram, the messaging application.
